# py-ananke

## Getting started

The Python package py-ananke requires py-EnBiD and py-Galaxia which are included in this repository as submodules. After cloning this repository and before any installation attempt, make sure to run `git submodule init && git submodule update` to pull the remote repository content of all submodules. The package py-ananke can eventually be installed using `pip install .` from the root of this repository. The command with flag `pip install . --no-cache-dir` may be necessary.
